## goals

* minimize the effort required for data entry
* make using the app something the user is looking forward to → [[#gameification]]
* generate a comprehensive data set for analysis → [[#data model]]
* be transparent with the user
* only safe user related data when absolutely necessary
* start generating the data set as early as possible → deploy to a beta test group ASAP → focus on [[#UX]] and [[#data model]]
* make a public map of areas that are less safe



## data model

We need to create a comprehensive data model that features all the attributes that are of importance for later analysis of the data.

## UX

Short for user experience. Here we try to find ways to make using the app easy, straightforward and pleasant. We want to keep the barrier as low as possible. Think of a user walking around doing things (whatever users do when they don't use the app). They should be able to quickly snap a picture and click on upload and go on with doing things without to much hassle.

## gameification

The goal is to reward the user for every data point they enter into the system.
To motivate them to actively search for new stickers etc. 
We can achieve this through [[#competition]] and [[#achievements]]

### competition
With implementing high scores we can motivate users to compete with each other in different competitions.


### achievements
Achievements on the other hand are something individual to the user.
Some examples could be:
* Find and remove an item in each district
* Find and remove a certain number of items
* Find something you are not certain about

One benefit of achievements would be that we can make them work locally (stored on the users device). Although this would not be a trivial task.
